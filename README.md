# K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-
One of the most fundamental yet important machine learning classification methods is KNN. It is heavily used in pattern recognition, data mining, and intrusion detection and is a member of the supervised learning domain. Since it is non-parametric, which means it does not make any underlying assumptions about the distribution of data (unlike other algorithms like GMM, which assume a Gaussian distribution of the given data), it is extensively applicable in real-life circumstances. An attribute-based prior data set (also known as training data) is provided to us, allowing us to classify coordinates into groups.
